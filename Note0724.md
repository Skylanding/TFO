First, let me Organize some previous thoughts and knowledge. This forms the foundation of the model.
Cardiac contractions cause arterial tissue to pulsate, periodically increasing the blood-tissue volume ratio, resulting in change of the light intensity seen at a detector. That's the principle of CW .The resulting periodic time-domain signal is called a photoplethysmogram (PPG). A PPG exhibits valleys and peaks, where each valley-to-peak excursion represents changes in arterial blood volume that correspond to systole and diastole. Since HbO2 and Hb absorb light at different levels for a particular wavelength, the PPG pulse depth at two wavelengths can be used to estimate the relative concentration of HbO2 in the pulsating (arterial)
tissue and provide a non-invasive measure of SpO2. 

Analytically, this approach utilizes the differential form of the Modified Beer-Lambert Law (dMBLL), which relates the change in light attenuation (∆A) to changes in the chromophore concentration between different tissue states:

这里我们用到的MBLL公式实际上是dMBLL公式，MBLL公式的微分形式




关于AC/DC的定义，我们要关注的其实是AC/DC如何对dMBLL公式的过程会产生什么影响。从脉动组织和非脉动组织的角度来看，其实AC,DC主要是影响一个调制比R。而这个调制比是我们用来估计SPO2的一个重要的系数。由于光源不同，直接利用红光和接近IR的光进行信号对比是不可靠的，因为红光和IR透过皮肤组织也会产生不同的吸收。左图是红光和IR透过皮肤的原始信号示意图.所以需要对原始信号处理一下。右图示意了处理后的信号（DC部分相等）

Regarding the definition of AC/DC, what we need to focus on is how AC/DC affects the process of the our dMBLL equation. From the perspectives of pulsatile and non-pulsatile tissues, AC and DC mainly influence a modulation ratio, denoted as "R." This modulation ratio is an important factor used to estimate SPO2 (oxygen saturation). Due to different light sources, direct signal comparison using red light and near-infrared (IR) light is unreliable because red light and IR light will experience different levels of absorption when passing through the skin tissue. The left image represents raw signals transmitted through the skin using red light and IR light. Therefore, it is necessary to preprocess the raw signals. The right image illustrates the processed signals with equalized DC components.

#### 2. Working principle of iNIRS

`a.   Forward model: how to obtain raw measurement (beating signal) from known sample structure (known time of flight curve)`

`b.   Inverse model: how to obtain time of flight (TOF) curve from measurement (beating signal).`

Fourier analysis of the detected signal is used to determine time of-flight (TOF) - resolved intensity, which is then analyzed over time to yield TOF-resolved intensity autocorrelations.

 iNIRS (center) provides a rich two-dimensional data set, GiNIRS 1 (τs, τd), that unifies incoherent and coherent diffuse optics. Through incoherent averaging, GiNIRS 1 (τs, 0) provides medium temporal point spread functions (TPSFs) like time domain (TD-) NIRS (left). Through time-of-flight (TOF) integration, R GiNIRS 1 (τs, τd)dτs can provide medium autocorrelations, like diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) (right).

iNIRS(中)提供了一个丰富的二维数据集，即GiNIRS 1 (τs， τd)，它统一了非相干和相干漫射光学。通过非相干平均，GiNIRS 1 (τs, 0)提供了类似时域(TD-) NIRS(左)的中等时间点扩展函数(tpsf)。通过飞行时间(TOF)积分，R GiNIRS 1 (τs， τd)dτs可以提供中等自相关性，如漫射相关光谱(DCS)(右)。

相比较于CW方式，TOF测量方式主要是引入了SDD，这使得我们可以计算公式不同layer情况下的求和，从而可以建立μa,ci与beating signal的关系。
从这里的TOF曲线可以看到，纵坐标是Intensity,横坐标是光子飞行时间。通过时域我们无法构造联系，所以我们将其变化为对于长度的曲线，这时实际上长度就可以划分为多个layer区域，这也使得我们的BLL公式两边是可以计算的。
我们从合作者得到的代码里，实际上他通过查资料或者是google给出的范围。因为目前首先要研究one subject，所以可以先关注maternal的信息。给出的Maternal Hb concentration和Maternal Saturation对应的一个范围，我们可以先通过这个范围去估计μa值。通过查询资料，我们假定𝜀𝐻𝑏的值是......




Compared to the CW method, the TOF method mainly introduces SDD, which allows us to calculate the sum under different layer conditions. Consequently, we can establish the relationship between μa and the beating signal.

From the TOF curve here, the vertical axis represents intensity, and the horizontal axis represents the photon flight time. Since we cannot establish a direct relationship in the time domain, we transform it into a curve with respect to length. This allows us to divide the actual length into multiple layer regions, enabling the calculation of both sides of our BLL.


In the code obtained from our collaborators, he actually provided ranges based on literature research or Google search. Since we are currently focusing on studying one subject first, we can prioritize maternal information. I isolate the data containing only Layer1 and Layer2 to be used as the subject for μa analysis. The given ranges for Maternal Hb concentration and Maternal Saturation can be used to estimate the μa value within these ranges.



Through literature research, we assume the value of 𝜀𝐻𝑏 to be 1102， and hbo2 to be 412

Then I conducted an analysis on the separated measurement lengths containing only the maternal data.











However, since the code does not explicitly specify the origin of the calculated μa, we can only speculate that it includes the absorption coefficient (μa) of the entire maternal layer. Therefore, the formula used here takes into account the layers L1 and L2 together for a rough estimation.
After performing data analysis on L1 and L2, their distributions can be obtained. Taking the average values as point estimates, we find that the mean after summing L1 and L2 together is 37.18. So he calculated intensity corresponding to the peak and valley values is here. However, there might be some unit conversion issues involved. This is simply used to represent the relative magnitude of the peak and valley values, demonstrating the process of converting TOF to the beating signal curve.
